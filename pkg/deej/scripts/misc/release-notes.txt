This release ___________:

- One awesome thing that happened
- Another awesome thing

**Launch instructions**

- **First-time users:** download the [Arduino sketch](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra/blob/master/microcontroller-scripts\Arduino\deej-5-sliders-6-buttons-vanilla.ino) and upload it to your board ([see full instructions here](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra#build-procedure))
- Download both `config.yaml` and `deej-extra.exe` (below, under _Assets_) and place them in the same directory
- Verify that your config has the correct COM port for your Arduino board
- Launch `deej-extra.exe`. You can always edit the config while deej is running

**_Linux users:_** for the time being, please build from source. You'll need `libgtk-3-dev`, `libappindicator3-dev` and `libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev` for system tray support. If there's demand for precompiled release binaries, please [let me know!](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra/issues)

> _Tip:_ If `deej-extra.exe` seems to crash or doesn't start, please [create an issue](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra/issues) the `logs\deej-latest-run.log` file from your `deej` directory.

> _Tip:_ `deej-extra-debug.exe` is a version with a console window that displays additional logs. If you have trouble getting things to work, [create an issue](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra/issues) or [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu) and post a snippet there.

More detailed instructions and documentation are in the [repo's main page](https://github.com/TomDra/deej-extra).

Enjoy!
