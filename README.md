# In this fork

This is a fork of a fork of deej.

This is forked from [here](https://github.com/Miodec/deej)

which is originally a fork of [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

This fork of deej has support for:
 - Running on startup
 - Remappable button support




# How to

 - Upload the Arduino code to your board (be sure to change the pin definitions).
 - Download the `deej-release.exe` file and `config.yaml` from the [release section](https://github.com/Miodec/deej/releases/tag/compile) (`deej-dev` will show a debug console window when launched)
 - Buttons must be defined in config with int values. The key values can be found here: https://github.com/micmonay/keybd_event/blob/master/keybd_windows.go (make sure to convert hex values to int)
 - If you run into any issues, feel free to ask in the [Deej Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nf88NJu)
